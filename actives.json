It requires 12 charges \u2013 6 full soul or black hearts \u2013 to be fully charged.\nIf the box requires two or more charges and Isaac picks up a black heart, then the box gains charge as for a soul heart and the last soul heart (or half soul heart, if there is one) in Isaac's health will become black.\nIf the box requires only one more charge and Isaac picks up a full soul heart or a black heart, then the box will become fully charged and one half heart of the same type will be added to Isaac's health.\nSoul health from Blended Hearts will also be used to charge the box. (They will, as usual, be used for red health first.)\nUpon activation, this item is consumed and will vanish from Isaac's inventory, spawning three Soul Hearts and two items from the Angel Room item pool.\nIf a Devil Deal was taken previously, it will spawn two Soul Hearts and one Angel Room item instead.\nThere is a chance for each one of the spawned soul hearts to be replaced with an Eternal Heart.",

The wisps are lost after leaving the room they were created in.\n Butter Bean: Inner ring. The wisps are white and do not shoot tears or deal contact damage, only 1 health each, release farts that knockback upon death and cannot be carried across rooms.\n The Candle: Wisp are blue and only exist within the current room. For each activation of the candle, a new wisp is added for the duration of the blue flame. If the wisp stays after the flame disappears depends on the type of charge used to activate the blue flame: For a green charge, it only stays if the generated blue flame hit an enemy. For a blue charge, the wisp always stays. Wisps are reset to one if the blue flame does not hit an enemy.\n Clear Rune: Spawns a purple-glowing rune wisp. Wisps fire normal tears and drop runes and soul stones when destroyed. They also have a 15% chance to drop a random rune when they kill an enemy.

It is very durable and has double shots.\n Doctor's Remote: Generates a wisp with a bomb-like appearance and grey aura. Wisps fire small grey tears when Isaac fires tears. When Doctor's Remote is activated, normal tears will fire from the wisps, followed by two separate rounds of larger, lighter grey tears, which explode on contact. Explosions will hurt Isaac. Tears fired from wisps surround the targeted area if close; if Isaac has more than four wisps, the tears will form a circle around the missile.\n Dull Razor: Inner ring.

The luck will not go away immediately if the wisps are destroyed, rather it is re-evaluated when a new wisp spawns, so the player may lose all their wisps but maintain their luck until they spawn a new one. Wisps generated by other items will not re-evaluate the luck, so it is possible to discard Fortune Cookie for another active item and keep the luck upgrade permanently, even once all of the green wisps are gone.\n Free Lemonade: Spawns large, yellow wisps that will spawn small puddles of yellow creep every two shots.

        "Tips for Obtaining": "Characters with high damage like  Judas or  Azazel are excellent for blazing through the first floor in enough time.\n Cain has decent health and damage as well as the highest base speed of any character.\nAzazel has flight and very high base speed, but his lack of any health besides Black Hearts can make surviving the rest of the run more difficult; his  0 - The Fool card allows him to return to the spawn room quickly; this is not needed to obtain the Broken Shovel, as there is no time limit to claim the shovel itself, however, one can use it to cut down on time should they go the wrong way first time around.\nPlaying Judas makes it impossible to obtain this item if certain conditions are met; if no soul hearts or bomb pickups spawn on the first floor or in the shop, and if the item spawned by the boss room does not increase your health, it will be impossible to perform the last step and obtain the Broken Shovel.\n Bethany's  Book of Virtues allows you to pick up the Broken Shovel while retaining the book. These cause the wisps to become tiny ghosts reminiscent of  The Soul. When a tear shot by the wisp hits an enemy, there's a chance for Mom's leg to stomp on them. Additionally, you can use the Broken Shovel using soul hearts, allowing for more frequent usage at the cost of not being able to pick up soul/black hearts throughout the run.\n Tainted Magdalene can be extremely powerful in this challenge, especially if one obtains the  Sharp Plug. Spamming her  Yum Heart can circumvent any and all damage taken, making her invincible while killing things, and can even be used offensively on its own once the Negative is obtained due to the Necronomicon effect, provided you are at the half heart interval (half heart -> 2 heart heal from Yum Heart -> take 2 hearts of damage to charge Yum Heart again, triggering The Negative).\nTry not to slow down for pickups, items, or any unnecessary rooms while progressing to the boss room. They can be returned to after clearing the rest of the floor and killing the boss.\nThere is no time limit on claiming the shovel, as long as the floor boss was killed within the time limit.\nSpawning the Broken Shovel early will force Isaac to carry it through the rest of the floor, increasing the chance of losing health; therefore, the shovel should only be spawned when Isaac is ready to move onto the next floor.\nEven if a bomb or an item that spawns bombs or explosions cannot be found, it is still possible to claim the shovel; if the requirements to claim the shovel are met, hurting Isaac in the Sacrifice Room will spawn a one-time bomb on the first hit.\nIf Isaac no longer has this bomb or does not have enough health to survive the sacrifice, the shovel will be unobtainable, forcing a restart.\nRestarting to spawn next to a Treasure Room can make runs with the Broken Shovel much easier.\n Look for items such as  Host Hat to trivialize the stomp damage, or for damage/tear-increasing items to kill enemies quicker; conversely, when running into a mini-boss, getting Curse of the Maze or Labyrinth, or encountering poor floor generation such as multiple large rooms and dead ends, restarting may be a better choice.\n Stomp damage can no longer be negated.\nThe shovel will only be obtainable if and only if the first-floor boss dies before the timer hits 01:00. If Mom's voice is not heard after the boss is defeated, the shovel will not be obtainable.\nIf the criteria to spawn the shovel are not met and there is ambiguity as to whether it is obtainable, look for a large, faint shadow of the shovel covering the spawn room; if it is not there, the shovel cannot be obtained.",

The Forgotten and  The Soul,   Jacob and Esau,  Tainted Lazarus and   Dead Tainted Lazarus, and   Tainted Forgotten and   Tainted Soul are all counted as inherently linked dual-characters.\nNon-tainted characters can only transform into other non-tainted characters, and tainted characters can only transform into other tainted characters.\nIt is possible for the Clicker to choose the same character as the one that is already being played as, making it seem like the item created no effect at all.\nTransforming into a new character does not grant Isaac the starting items of the new character unless they are inherent to the character. For example, transforming into  Cain does not grant  Lucky Foot.\nHealth is conserved between characters.\nAll Red Heart containers will be lost, and all bone heart containers will be emptied when changing into  ???,   Dark Judas,   Tainted ???,   Tainted Judas or   Tainted Forgotten. They will gain a half Soul Heart if they would otherwise have no health.\nAll health will be lost when changing into  The Lost. Changing from The Lost to any other character will leave them with a half Soul Heart.\n  Keeper will always start with 2 Coin Heart containers. Bone and Half Soul/Black Hearts will be rounded up to 1 or 2 filled coins. Red Hearts are not rounded which allows him to have half Coin Hearts. Changing from Keeper to any other character will turn his Coin Hearts into Red Hearts.\n All Red Heart containers are converted to Coin Heart containers when transforming into Keeper, with a minimum of 2 and up to a maximum of 3. Only red hearts will determine if the coin heart containers are filled or not, and Soul/Black hearts will be converted into blue flies. One coin heart container will be filled if he would otherwise have no health. Changing from Keeper to any other character will turn his Coin Hearts into Red Hearts.\nChanging into  The Forgotten will not affect  The Soul's health. Red Hearts are converted into Bone Hearts. Soul/Black Hearts will be lost. He will gain an empty Bone Heart if he would otherwise have no health.\n All soul hearts will be converted to soul charges when changing into  Bethany. She will gain one full Red Heart container if she would otherwise have no health. Changing from Bethany to any other character will convert her soul charges into soul hearts.\n Heart Containers will be divided evenly and split up when changing into  Jacob and Esau. Changing from Jacob and Esau to any other character will leave them with Jacob and Esau's combined health.\nActivating Clicker typically only consumes passive items, but with  Schoolbag it can consume the item in the other activated item slot if that item was the most recently collected.\nSimilarly to items such as  Judas' Shadow and  Lazarus' Rags, any completion marks obtained will correspond with the character the Clicker turns you into.\n  Tainted Cain can craft the Clicker and other useful items and then use Clicker to change characters.  In this way, runs started as Tainted Cain can be useful to complete other character's completion marks, even when Tainted Cain's own completion marks are finished.  Although Clicker will only turn tainted characters into other tainted characters, Tainted Cain can also craft  Lazarus' Rags and die to become a non-tainted character and could then use the Clicker to change into other non-tainted characters.\n Removed items still count towards transformations.\nChanging into  Eden or   Tainted Eden will not use tokens. Additionally, (Tainted) Eden's base stats will be the same as Isaac's if he wasn't the character selected at the start of the run.\n Changing into  Jacob and Esau will randomly distribute items between the two. Changing from Jacob and Esau to any other character will leave them with Jacob and Esau's combined items.\nIf  Dead Cat was the last item to be picked up, Clicker will remove individual lives instead of the entire item.\nIf  Halo of Flies was the last item to be picked up, Clicker will only remove one fly at a time (including Pretty Flies obtained from pills and Slot Machines) instead of the entire item.",

Mr. Maw and Gemini's cord dots are considered pieces, each turning into a new monster.\nUsing this item in a room with Grimaces will turn them invisible. They will not fire, but the space they occupied will prevent Isaac from moving through it like an invisible wall.\nUsing this item in a room with Mom's Hand can be very dangerous, as unless they have already landed, they will be directly on top of Isaac, resulting in the new monsters spawning directly on top of Isaac, instantly dealing contact damage.\n Using this item with  Broken Remote will first teleport the player and then reroll the enemies in the new room.\nUsing this item, then exiting the room, such as by teleporting or a bombed door, will cause the enemies to be in their original forms upon your return.\nThis item is of little utility in  Chest or in  Dark Room because the D10 doesn't reroll bosses and most of the rooms are populated by bosses.",

If there are multiple enemies/projectiles caught in the attack, each consecutive attack deals an additional flat 3.5 damage. At the end of the effect, an area of effect blast is created, dealing more damage the more enemies or bullets were pierced during the effect.\nFor every enemy/bullet Isaac walked through, he will gain a temporary +1 damage bonus, which wears off at a rate of -0.25 damage every half second.\nThe damage of the blast at the end of Dark Arts is equal to the sum of every damage dealt while dashing between enemies.\nBullets walked through will still count for the final blast damage calculation, even though they can't really be damaged.",

Also, the Brimstone beam created will still be active while Dark Arts is active.\n Mars: Isaac is able to dash while using Dark Arts, allowing him to reach more enemies in one use of Dark Arts while still dealing damage with Mars' dash.\n 120 Volt: 120 Volt will still activate while using Dark Arts, allowing Isaac to deal more damage to nearby enemies while invulnerable.\n Taurus: Will be activated during the usage of Dark Arts, activating the invincibility in the same instant that Dark Arts is activated.\n Gnawed Leaf: If Isaac is stationary when Dark Arts ends, he will gain invulnerability without any downtime. Dark Arts can also be used from invulnerability without taking damage.\n Aquarius: Due to the nature of Dark Arts, Isaac can easily damage enemies with the trail left behind.\n Rock Bottom: Rock Bottom will prevent your damage from decreasing, allowing you to keep the highest achieved damage bonus.\n Car Battery: Dark Arts will last twice as long, totaling at 2 seconds per use. If you end Dark Arts early, a second Dark Arts will activate for the time that you had remaining.\n Camo Undies: If used at the start of a room, after Dark Arts' effect ends, Isaac re-enters Stealth.\nWisps: Wisps cannot be destroyed while Dark Arts is in effect and still deal contact damage.\n Ipecac: Because Dark Arts' damage is scaled off of tear damage, Ipecac gives an extremely high damage boost to each Dark Arts hit, easily capable of destroying some early bosses in a single hit.\n Euthanasia: When Dark Arts ends, each enemy tagged may instantly die and release a burst of black tears as if hit by a Euthanasia tear.\n Friend Finder: Dark Arts can be used on friendly mobs created by Friend Finder without killing them, but still giving you the damage boost.\n Friendly Ball: Enemies which spawn other enemies can be captured and used to generate infinite damage, as the enemies they spawn will also be friendly.",
        "Interactions": "Libra: Libra is extremely detrimental to how Dark Arts works, and should be avoided: The speed boost during the invincibility phase is transferred into attack bonuses (Which are useless as tears cannot be used), and afterwards, the temporary damage boost is divided across all of Isaac's stats, resulting in very negligible stat boosts.\nFamiliars such as  Cube of Meat that block projectiles will make it difficult to gain damage off of projectiles, as they destroy any projectiles they come in contact with.\nClots: Clots will gain increased speed and be no longer be able to fire, but will still be vulnerable to damage while Isaac is using Dark Arts. They will most likely hit any enemies or projectiles Isaac runs through if the player does not use the drop button to make them stay still.\nUsing  Pause while there are enemies and also tagging the White Fire Place will extinguish it.",

Both forms will also be unable to turn into The Soul. If used as  The Soul, Esau Jr. will not be bound to The Forgotten's Body. If used again to turn back into The Soul, The Forgotten's Body will also be summoned alongside them, but the player cannot turn back into them, preventing them from moving between rooms and causing a softlock.\n Tainted Magdalene: Esau Jr.'s starting black hearts will quickly drain down to half a heart; he must obtain heart containers while in this form to have any survivability.\n Tainted Cain: The items given to Esau Jr. on the first use are based on the item pool of the first room Tainted Cain gained an item from. Other abilities are unchanged.\n Tainted Eden: Taking damage will turn Esau Jr. back into Tainted Eden, along with all of its other effects.

This includes enemies summoned from bosses such as Brownie's spawned Dips or The Cage's unique Vises.\nOne exception to this is if you capture a Portal, as it can spawn enemies such as Death's Head.\nIt is generally wasteful to use this item on Mulligans and their variants as they will immediately rush towards enemies and try to kill themselves, leaving behind friendly debris.\nIf the captured enemy is a Globin variant (besides Black Globins for their lack of regenerative abilities) or a Dark Red Champion, the enemy will regenerate after dying, granting a much longer lifespan.\nWall Creeps and their variants stick to walls, backing far away from any potential danger they might encounter.\nStationary enemies that move underground (such as Round Worms or Lumps) work surprisingly well as an ally as they shoot foes from far away and rarely ever get hurt.\nMom's Hand and Mom's Dead Hand will both one-shot almost all normal enemies and greatly damage most bosses with an incredibly small window for the hands to be hit, making them ideal for capturing.\nBrimstone-capable enemies are very potent as their lasers can cause an obscene amount of damage to both enemies and most bosses.\nIf the captured enemy is one that spawns enemies, those enemies will be friendly as well.\nIf the ally is immune to damage (such as a Walking Host while its head is lowered), it will not take contact damage.\nIf the captured enemy is a Solid White Champion, it will be completely invincible, as it cannot be killed until the room counts as being cleared, at which point it can be killed by spikes or a Wall Hugger.\n If the captured enemy is a Pulsing Red Champion, it will regenerate the health of other monsters in the room, including friendly ones.\n If an enemy that leaves behind a trail of damaging creep is caught, the creep created by the friendly mob will still damage Isaac when he walks over it.\n All creep created by a friendly enemy will only hurt grounded enemies and not the player.\nThe ball will only capture one segment of a Grub, one Buttlicker, or one Swarm Fly. However, when releasing a Swarm Fly, a new swarm is generated for it.\nIf a Heart is caught and then released, a Mask can use the friendly heart to live even if its original heart is destroyed. The room will not be cleared unless the Mask is killed.\nThe mask will ignore the friendly heart yet can still damage it. Bait the mask to charge towards the heart to destroy both.\nIf an Ipecac-capable enemy is caught, the explosive Ipecac shots it fires will not hurt Isaac.\nThis explosion immunity also applies to enemies that explode on death, and even the Troll Bombs left behind by Mulligoons.\nThe head of Rag Man can be captured by the ball while detached. It will not become a Ragling after being released, and only chases enemies by rolling.\nCaptured Bishops will protect Isaac with their shield generation ability, as well as all other friendly enemies. Isaac cannot take any damage while the Bishop is alive, as it will protect him with the shield. Protecting the Bishop can be a powerful defensive tool, especially when playing as  The Lost.\nThe shield does not protect against instant death effects such as  Suicide King or  Plan C.\nCaptured Cultists will revive killed enemies as friendlies, allowing one to slowly amass an army of friendlies by protecting the Cultist.\nBosses and degraded bosses can be revived by a friendly Cultist, but will not persist between rooms.",

It has a Bed, two random Chests, two Sacks, and a random Trinket. The only way out is through the beam of light.\nThis includes resetting the character to the initial one even if you transformed due to items such as  Ankh.\nFor every item removed using Genesis, there will be a set of three items from the removed item's pool to choose from, each set appearing one after the other.\nIf you have multiple copies of an item being removed, the amount of extra choices you get is how many copies of that item you have squared. (4 of the same item -> 16 choices in Genesis)\nIf used on one of the final floors of the game, such as  Chest or  Dark Room, the beam of light will be replaced with a Crawl Space that leads Isaac back to the starting room of the floor he used it on. In addition, the aforementioned chests will include items. These items will not disappear along the \"choice\" pedestals.\nIf used during The Beast's fight, it will merely teleport Isaac to the middle of the room, removing no items from him.\nIf used in  ???, the beam will teleport Isaac to  Cathedral.",
        "Notes": "Genesis will remove all currently active curses, meaning Curse of the Blind will not affect the item pedestals present inside the room.\nIf used as  Jacob and Esau or  Tainted Lazarus, or in Co-op, both the characters will get all their items removed, but you'll be only presented with replacement pedestals for items removed from the character using Genesis, likely resulting in a net item loss.\nJacob and Esau cannot take two items at once from the choices offered by Genesis.\n Tainted Bethany will lose all of her  Lemegeton fires upon use, but not her red heart charges. This allows the player to quickly gather power again after the reset.\nIf used as  Tainted Forgotten, the link between the two characters is broken. If an item is picked up as the Soul, it is added to the Soul; if the Forgotten is thrown at an item, it is added to the Forgotten. With this method, it is possible to give the Soul items such as orbitals or passive abilities that will help protect it; however, any stat upgrades are rendered useless when picked up as the Soul. Sleeping in the bed as the Soul will not grant any hearts; the Forgotten must be thrown at the bed. It should be noted that the run must be exited and reopened after entering the beam of light to avoid a glitch that kills the Soul in 1 hit.\nIf used as  Eden, a new set of items and stats will be generated. The first random passive item Eden starts with is rerolled immediately with no choice of three.\nIf used as  Keeper after getting the extra health from beating hush, the health cap is set back to 2 (bug?)\nIf you are on the alternate path, the trapdoor can deviate you from this path.\nUsing Genesis after defeating Mom's Heart on  Mausoleum II will teleport the player to a room that is empty besides a trapdoor leading to  Corpse I and the three item selections.\nIf items such as  Teleport,  Teleport 2.0, Telepills, etc, are obtained inside of the Genesis Room, the player may use them to teleport back to the main floor and avoid the necessary floor skip.\nPlayers should be cautious when using unidentified pills or opening red chests inside the Genesis Room before collecting all offered items, as all teleportation effects will remove Isaac from the special room with no way back.\nSince Genesis resets the player character's health, it is one way to remove Broken Hearts.\nUsing  Pandora's Box gives you  The Bible and taking it does not affect the other 3 choices.\nCrawl spaces can be generated and entered inside the Genesis room, but upon leaving them, you will be returned to the floor Genesis was used on instead of returning to the room.\nSimilarly, a red chest or Joker can teleport Isaac to a Devil/Angel Room, and leaving will return Isaac to the room Genesis was used in.\nItem tables will be reset, and any lost items can be obtained again if they spawn.\nUsing Genesis will remove some important items (such as Knife Pieces), but not others (like  The Polaroid,  The Negative, Key Pieces, etc.).\nGenesis does not remove  Missing No. or  Damocles.\nAs Genesis cannot remove Damocles, it will work in the Genesis room as well, meaning that each set of choice pedestals will spawn an extra set.\nIt also does not remove the downside of  Magic Skin; items can still be replaced by it even after Genesis is used.\nUsing Genesis after collecting  Eden's Blessing during the run will spawn Isaac in the Genesis room already holding a random item. This consumes Eden's Blessing, and the next run the player starts will not start with a random item.\nTake caution; choosing an active item while holding another one will not drop your previous item to the ground, but replace it.\nUsing  Glowing Hour Glass works as intended and will give you back your stats, items, pickups, and health.\nUsing  Crooked Penny has a 50% chance to cause item pedestals to duplicate, as normal. Otherwise, they will disappear and no new ones will spawn.\nUsing  D7 will spawn three items, all of which can be taken.\nRemoves Tainted Keeper's quad shot tear cap, likely a bug.

Isaac gains 1.5 range and leaves a trail of red creep behind him, identical to the effects of  Anemic for the rest of the current room.\nIf the damage from breaking Glass Cannon would result in death, Isaac will remain at half a heart, gaining half a soul heart if necessary. This does not apply if the damage Isaac took would be lethal before the extra damage is taken.",
        "Notes": "The item recharges actively after use, similar to items like  The Boomerang, allowing repeated usage within the same room.\nShooting the Glass Cannon gives a slight knockback effect to Isaac, which can be dangerous in rooms with obstacles like spikes or Fire Places.",

Tears are harder to feed as they will burst very quickly but they can be fed if you fire tears beforehand and then fire Glass Cannon into those tears.\n Mysterious Liquid: Creates a large pool of creep when tears land.\n Tiny Planet: Tears produced by Glass Cannon will orbit Isaac.",

        "Notes": "Does not return extra lives.\nIf the Glowing Hour Glass to go back in time to previous room, without moving to another room after the activation, each use will multiply some familiars that persist through rooms by duplicating them. (This is possibly a bug)\nFamiliars that can be multiplied:\nBlood Clots from  Tainted Eve/ Sumptorium\nBlue flies and spiders\n Abyss locusts\nFriendly monsters spawned by items (i.e.  Friend Finder)\nMini-Isaacs spawned by  Giant Cell\nWisps\nWisps from  Vengeful Spirit act very unusual, they appear at the entrance of each room Isaac enters and shoot in the direction that Isaac currently shooting. Wisps from the  Book of Virtues that exceed the limit of 26 wisps will have this same behavior.\n Lemegeton wisps, however, do not retain this behavior and will still spin around Isaac even if they exceed they limit of 26 possible wisps, they also only multiply existing ones.\nThere appears to be a limit to the number of familiars that can be gained through this method.\nUsing a  Joker and then the Glowing Hour Glass to return does not guarantee a Devil Room for every floor as the Joker card does not get refunded. The reason for this is that you immediately change rooms after the Joker card is used, as such reverting to before it was used is impossible.\nDoes not return health lost entering or leaving a Curse Room, as the health was lost in the previous room.\n Does not return keys or health used to enter special rooms.\nDoes not preserve the Devil Room or Angel Room door if used to return to the Boss Room.\nDoes not turn a character back into another should they have been revived by  Ankh,  Lazarus' Rags, or  Judas' Shadow.\n Character changes are reverted by Glowing Hour Glass.\n Does not affect the chance for a portal to  The Void to spawn (the portal will not spawn if it didn't spawn initially).\nDonations to the Donation Machine or Greed Machine are not reverted, and they can be reset into a working state once jammed.\nOther counters not tied to your specific run, such as Slot Machines or Tinted Rocks destroyed, continue to accumulate, allowing easy unlocking of secrets such as the  Counterfeit Penny, the  D4, and Conquest if you have access to infinite uses of the Glowing Hour Glass (see below).\nWith the Curse of the Blind, Glowing Hour Glass can be used to pick up or purchase an unknown item to see what it is, then decide whether or not to undo picking it up.\nUsing the Glowing Hour Glass to prevent picking the Glowing Hour Glass up while previously having had an active item will return the active item and discharge it completely.\nNo Damage Achievements are still available if the Glowing Hour Glass is used to reset damage.\n Perfection is still able to drop if the Glowing Hour Glass is used to reset damage.\n Isaac's temporary familiars (Blue Flies and Spiders) duplicate when using the Glowing Hour Glass.\nIf combined with  The Battery or  Sharp Plug while Blue Spiders are present, this combo can generate an infinite army of Blue Spiders.\nThe Retro Vision Pill will continue to affect the game even after using the Glowing Hour Glass.\n Can be used to unlock multiple achievements tied to the killing of certain bosses such as Mom's Heart / It Lives.\nIf there is a Lil' Battery in a Shop, the Glowing Hour Glass can be used infinitely, by entering the Shop without a charge and using the Lil' Battery to recharge and exit the shop. This is useful for duplicating temporary familiars or filling up the Donation Machine, among other uses.\n Using the Glowing Hour Glass right after beating Mom's Heart / It Lives / Ultra Greed allows you to get additional Eden tokens.\n If a new game is started and  Eden begins with this item, using it in the first room will cause the game to crash.\nDoes not remove collection page entries if it undoes collecting an item for the first time.\n Using the Glowing Hour Glass after beating Mom's Heart in  Mausoleum/ Gehenna II will transport the player to the previous room without the Knife Pieces, but the door to Mom's Heart will also be closed. The following floor will be  Womb/ Utero/ Scarred Womb and not  Corpse.\n Using the Glowing Hour Glass after entering a new floor will teleport you back to the boss room of the previous floor.\n  Bethany's soul heart container does not get reset upon activating this item.\n If  Tainted Jacob is hit by Esau, using the Glowing Hour Glass will return him to normal form in the previous room.\n The guaranteed angel room chance can be preserved if the item is used after entering the first devil room.\n If used during The Beast fight, it will teleport Isaac to the center of the room and have no further effect.\n May be helpful for finding Planetariums, as it lets the player effectively skip item rooms while also seeing if what's inside them is worth taking.\n The chance of a Planetarium generating on future floors can be preserved if Isaac enters one for the first time and then uses Glowing Hour Glass to leave, effectively allowing Isaac to reroll his Planetarium until a desired item is found.",
        "Synergies": "? Card: Allows for infinite usage as the ? Card gets refunded upon usage.\n 4.5 Volt: Allows for infinite usage in rooms where a lot of damage can be dealt, most notably boss rooms.\n48 Hour Energy pill: Allows for infinite usage as the pill gets refunded upon use.\n  9 Volt: Clearing any room is enough to instantly recharge the hourglass, allowing infinite tries for best outcome.\n With  AAA Battery the hourglass is instantly recharged.\n The Battery: When the item is double charged and used it will also refund the used extra charge bar, making it possible to use it endlessly.\n Bum Friend: Using the Glowing Hour Glass after the Bum Friend has picked up coins but before it has spawned pickups will restore the coins in the room but will still cause the Bum Friend to drop pickups. This can be used to repeatedly generate pickups from the same set of coins.\n Curse of the Tower: If used quickly after taking damage, Troll bombs will spawn in the previous room. If you have the  Safety Scissors, these can be harvested as normal.\n Dark Bum: Using the Glowing Hour Glass after the Dark Bum has picked up hearts but before it has spawned Soul Hearts will restore the hearts in the room but will still cause the Dark Bum to drop Soul Hearts. This can be used to repeatedly generate Soul Hearts from the same set of hearts.\n Duality: Time can be reversed while inside one deal to go into another.\n Eraser +  Schoolbag: Using Glowing Hourglass to return to the previous stage will keep the charge Eraser received from entering the next stage.\n Habit: Allows rooms to be repeated infinitely as long as Isaac has enough health to take  two ( three) hits, which are refunded on use.\n Hairpin: If Hairpin is held while entering any Boss Room for the first time, Glowing Hourglass may be used indefinitely on said room to repeat the fight until you beat it.\nOnly applies after Booster Pack 5.\n More Options: If used after entering the Treasure Room for the first time, upon reentering the room, one item will have changed places and another will be new, effectively making More Options a choice of 3 items instead of 2. If used a second time, the items change back.\n Moving Box: Using the Glowing Hour Glass after retrieving it from Moving Box will not deplete its charge. Allows for infinite usage as long as Moving Box is fully charged.\n Saturnus: Using the Glowing Hourglass will activate the effect of Saturnus again, essentially allowing for double the amount of orbiting tears, if the player returns to a room, where the tears created by Saturnus were not destroyed.\n Sharp Plug: Allows for infinite usage as long as you have more than 2 ( 1.5) full hearts as the hearts used to charge will be refunded upon use.",
        "Interactions": "Bag of Crafting: The bag's contents will be reverted to its previous state.\n Book of Virtues: Any wisps lost in the previous room will be restored, and an additional Glowing Hour Glass wisp will be added.\n Car Battery: No effect.\n Void: It is impossible to absorb a Glowing Hour Glass pedestal without using the item and preventing it from having been absorbed.\n The Glowing Hour Glass is absorbed like normal. Subsequent uses of Void send Isaac back to the previous room reverting most changes, nullifying many other effects that Void may have absorbed. Energy is still reset back to full upon each use, allowing for infinite re-tries of any room. This does, however, prevent you from consuming any further powers as you will instead reset the room.",

This means that some bosses that might seem to finish their death animations after Isaac dies, such as Ultra Greed, will still be technically killed and will still give their completion marks, even if Isaac does not enter the Final Boss Chest.\nSome bosses have special interactions with this item:\nAttempting to use this item to kill Delirium will not work. Its death animation is much longer than the time between using Plan C and Isaac's Last Will appearing, meaning Isaac will die first and it will not count as a kill. Having extra lives that revive Isaac outside the room will not help, either; Delirium must be fought again.\nHowever, items that revive Isaac in the same room he died in, namely  Lazarus' Rags (or being  Lazarus),  Inner Child,  Soul of Lazarus, and  Tainted Lost's  Birthright, will allow Isaac to bypass this and kill Delirium with this item. In the case of Lazarus' Rags, though, the completion mark will go toward Lazarus and not the character originally selected.\n Will not work if used against Ultra Greed's second phase as Tainted Forgotten, The Lost, Tainted Lost, or Tainted Jacob in his lost form, and using this item as him will kill Dark Esau, meaning it practically doesn't work at all.\n Fails against Mother regardless of phase.\n Killing Dogma with Plan C will kill Isaac while the screen is faded to black. Any extra life item, including those that revive him outside the room, will work and still take him to the Beast fight.\n The Beast and the Ultra Harbingers can all be killed simultaneously by Plan C. Isaac technically dies a few frames before the ending plays, but it is still counted as a win and thus Plan C can still be safely used, even without an extra life.\nInvulnerable enemies and closed Hosts will not be killed by Plan C.\nIsaac's last will shows his last damage source as the cause of death, not Plan C.  If Isaac has not taken damage or lost health from any source, Isaac's face is shown.\nInvincibility or the  Holy Mantle shield will not save Isaac from being killed.\nSome items that activate when Isaac reaches zero hearts, such as  Heartbreak and  Spirit Shackles, will not activate and save Isaac.\nEven if Isaac enters a trapdoor immediately after using Plan C, he will still die after arriving at the next floor.\nIsaac will also die after accepting a Victory Lap or performing a RERUN.\nPlan C has an 80% decreased item pool weight, making it less likely to appear than other collectibles.",

Trying to use it will not waste its charge.\nUsing the item multiple times at once (e.g. by picking up batteries) will make the body float and slowly travel towards the Soul. During this time period, both the body and the Soul are immune to all forms of damage until the body is retrieved. The body will float for a maximum of 5 seconds per charge used unless the Soul comes in contact with it.\nThe body is still able to perform its normal attack while floating mid-air.\nThe damage immunity can be used to play Demon Beggars, Blood Donation Machines and Confessionals free of charge.\nDamage will still be received if the body touches them.\nDoes not apply to Sacrifice Rooms and damage-triggered items, such as  IV Bag or  Blood Rights.\nThe body won't deal contact damage while floating. Damage is dealt only when the body snaps back to the Soul.\nObtaining Recall on any other character has no effect.",

It can pass over pits, but can not travel through obstacles.\n Flames will also disappear after 10 seconds.While Isaac holds the candle above his head, his movement speed is reduced.\nFlames remain active until depleted by dealing damage to enemies or upon changing rooms.\nThere is no limit to the number of fires that can be active. This is useful in situations where mob spawning can be controlled: for example, beating Boss Rush or Greed Mode as  The Lost. This is time-consuming but can be viable if your other sources of damage are weak or unreliable.\n Boss behavior in Boss Rush is not as predictable as in the original game, so more fires must be placed around the room.\nIt will block Isaac's tears but won't burn him.\nFlames do not drop any collectibles when doused.\nFlames will destroy shopkeepers.\nWhen using  The Ludovico Technique, when the fire hits the tear, the tear resets and appears again on the player.\nIsaac's tears can also shrink the size of the flame.\nThe  9 Volt decreases the recharge time of the item.\nThe flames from this item can put out fireplaces.\n Flames do not block player shots, nor are they put out by them.",

Flat File does as well, but ruins sacrifice rooms unless dropped.\nItems and trinkets that give any additional charges or create red rooms, if used together, can potentially open enough doors to do it forever.Red Key and  Schoolbag or in coop or as  Jacob and Esau offer many combinations:\n Diplopia or a successful  Crooked Penny used on the key can allow you to hold two keys at once.\n Glowing Hour Glass can restart the room if an opened room was not a special room (such as a Treasure room, Planetarium, Angel room, etc.)\n Soul of Cain /  Rune of Jera and  Clear Rune can work together with the Red Key to create many, many red rooms.\n D1 can duplicate batteries for the red key to then use.\n D7 can restart a room to get an extra charge, re-roll a greed fight that took place in a shop into a functioning shop and give extra mini-boss payouts.\n The D6 (self explanatory)\n D Infinity can do both D1's, D7's and The D6's effects as well as continue its usefulness with access to other die.\n Mom's Box can create any of the trinkets mentioned above and will double its effect if able.\n Coupon will help save lots of money in red Shops and give you free red devil room items.",
        "Notes": "A Pound of Flesh will, in most circumstances, heavily reduce the value of shops created and it is arguably not a good idea to take it with Red Key. However, this doesn't apply to  Keeper's Bargain\n Member Card in red Shops don't create new areas and they all connect much like Crawl Spaces\nIn  Home, Isaac can create a room on the left side of the map right under Mom's room. This room contains the Tainted characters.\nIf the respective Tainted character has already been found or a Tainted character is played, and the item  Inner Child has been unlocked, this room will contain the item instead. If Inner Child has not been unlocked, the room will contain a Shopkeeper.\nIf a door created by Red Key takes Isaac outside of the 13x13 area of the floor, he will be taken to the I AM ERROR room.\nIsaac can't exit this room, forcing him to use the trapdoor unless he has a teleport.\nThis method don't work in  Corpse II,  Chest,  Dark Room,  The Void, or the floor of  Dad's Note (the special version of   Mausoleum /  Gehenna II). No door outlines will appear at any boundary walls.\nAdditionally, this method also doesn't work during Red Redemption.\nThe I AM ERROR room can only be entered from another red room. Normal rooms will not show the red outline if they are at the map's boundary.\nThe I AM ERROR room will not show up on the map when created.\nAll rooms made by Red Key will be 1x1 rooms that can have doors available on all sides.\nRed rooms enable Isaac to enter several special rooms on the normal map without any resources or special conditions. These include the Secret and Super Secret room, both types of Challenge Rooms, Vaults, and Bedrooms.\nRed Shop rooms will regularly not offer items from the Shop item pool for sale, but draw from Boss and Treasure Room pool instead. Additionally, red shops have a chance to become advanced shops with many more items for sale, like Tainted Keeper's advanced shops.\nRed Key can't overwrite Secret Rooms or Super Secret Rooms. This can be used to discern the location of secret rooms by finding walls that don't have red door outlines in a valid red room spot.\nRed Key can't create a room adjacent to the Boss Room in most floors, with some exceptions:\nRed Key can create a room adjacent to Hush's room in the top right where the room that leads to  The Void usually generates. The door to this looks like a crack.\nThis red room can only be created when Isaac is in another red room adjacent to it, i.e. from branching off one of the Treasure Rooms and going around Hush's room. Isaac cannot create it inside the boss room, even after Hush is defeated.\nIsaac can enter Hush's room from this crack, but going the other direction will lead him to the Entrance Portal room.\nRed Key can create rooms adjacent to boss rooms in  The Void, including Delirium's room.\nIsaac can use this mechanic to find Delirium's room by creating rooms until he gets two adjacent rooms with boss doors on the same wall.\nBeware that there's a small chance you'll find Mr.Fred instead.\nRed Key can create rooms adjacent to the boss room in the mirrored world of  Downpour /  Dross II.\nAside from  XVIII - The Moon?, Red Key is the most reliable way to reach Ultra Secret Rooms, which have the  Home floor layout and are very likely to contain an Angel Room item.\nWhen Isaac enters any red room adjacent to the Ultra Secret Room, it immediately appears on the map along with the Secret Room sound, and its door will automatically open.\nIf Isaac encounters a red Special Room, all of its doors will be its special theme doors.\nAll doors in a red Curse Room still feature spikes, which will damage Isaac if he decides to enter / exit.\nA red Vault's doors or a red Dice Room's doors each require two keys to open. The door where Isaac uses Red Key will be automatically unlocked, but the other doors remain locked until Isaac goes through them from inside or unlocks them from outside.\nMultiple red special rooms of the same type can spawn on one floor.\nAll Sacrifice Rooms made by Red Key will have their own independent use counters and rewards.\nIf Isaac has a teleport to a specific room (The Stars, The Hermit,  Teleport 2.0, etc.) and has created a special room such that there are multiple of a certain type on one floor, the teleport will choose randomly between each room.\nHowever, if Isaac has found a red Planetarium, The Stars always teleports Isaac to it over any Treasure Rooms.\nIt is possible to obtain Knife Pieces outside of the intended methods by spawning Treasure Rooms that contain them.\nIn  Downpour II or  Dross II, if Isaac enters a red room after touching the white fire and becoming  The Lost, he will still be The Lost in every red room, but will change back to the original character when entering a normal room.\nIsaac is allowed to create red rooms in the mirror world of  Downpour II or  Dross II. They will be reflections of the original floor's red rooms, and special rooms created in this way will still be empty.\nRed rooms can't be created around the Knife Piece 2 area of   Mines II or  Ashpit II.\nRed Rooms on  Depths I/II can contain Marked Skulls.\nRed rooms created in  Downpour or  Dross I/II may contain the white fire, which allows Isaac to switch into  The Lost temporarily.\nRed rooms created in  Mines or  Ashpit I/II may contain the special yellow buttons used to create the minecart path. These buttons have no actual effects. Even in floor II, you still need to find all the three original buttons.\nThe initial rooms from  Chest and  Dark Room, with their respective chests, can be created by the Red Key, when in those floors.\nNew Mega Satan doors can't be found in these rooms.\nRed chests in a red starting room of  Dark Room won't contain any Devil Deals and function as normal red chests.",

The key damages enemies, as well as opens locked doors and chests it hits.\nThe key will also break the first rock it hits, as well as Key Blocks.\nThe thrown key does damage equal to 5x Isaac's damage + 30.\nEnemies killed by Sharp Key have a chance to spawn the contents of a chest; the contents they can drop includes the rewards of any possible chest contents, including items.",
        "Notes": "Thrown keys follow the same unlocking rules as  Dad's Key: They can unlock Secret Rooms, the doors to access  Mines,  Mausoleum, Mom's Heart in Mausoleum/Gehenna, Mega Satan, and the Strange Door. However, it cannot be used as a substitute for  Red Key or open the doors to Boss Rush or  ???.\nDoors will be opened in one thrown key, even if they require multiple keys or bombs to open.\nThe only rooms Dad's Key can open that Sharp Key cannot are (Boss) Challenge Rooms.\nThrown keys can also destroy Angel statues, but not fire places.\nThrown keys cannot pierce or destroy Stoneys.\nDestroying a rock will create a bridge at the opposite side the thrown key hit the rock from.\nDespite being a substitute to bombs, thrown keys will not destroy shopkeepers.\nThrown keys will open all the locked chests they move through, allowing multiple chests to be opened with a single key.\nOnly locked chests (such as Golden Chests, Eternal Chests, or Old Chests) can be opened by Sharp Key; all other chests are unaffected.\nIn the case of Eternal Chests, thrown keys will only count toward opening the chest one time.\nOpening locked chests with thrown keys in Challenge rooms will not cause the challenge room to start spawning enemies.\nThrown keys will retain Isaac's tear/status effects, but are unaffected by items that replace Isaac's tears (such as  Dr. Fetus,  Brimstone, or  Mom's Knife).\nWhether or not an enemy gives chest contents when killed by Sharp Key is seeded per enemy. As such, rooms can be re-entered (using Sharp Key itself or with  Door Stop /  Mercurius etc.) before they're fully cleared to repeatedly get rewards from the same enemy.\nThe type of chest that enemies will give the contents of is determined by standard chest generation rules. This makes the contents of standard chests more common, and prevents enemies from giving the contents of Old chests or Mom's chest.\nThe pickups enemies killed by Sharp Key can drop are affected by items/trinkets that modify chest spawns/rewards.",

The pickups they can drop will also include runes and batteries.\n The Left Hand: Enemies will only give the contents of red chests.\nAs locked/red chests are able to give Items whereas normal chests cannot, the previous two trinkets also allow items to be obtained through Sharp Key more consistently. Mom's Key: Doubles the amount of pickups dropped by enemies.",
        "Interactions": "Daemon's Tail: Enemies are much less likely to drop hearts; these hearts will still be black hearts.Golden Keys: Ignored by Sharp Key; it will still require and consume keys to use.\n Guppy's Eye: There will be no overlay on enemies that would drop pickups on death.\n Poker Chip: Enemies have a 50/50 chance to spawn extra pickups or an Attack Fly: The attack fly will be instantly killed by the thrown key.\nSpectral Tears: Rocks that thrown keys pass over have a chance of being destroyed.

The blood clots deal 3x Tainted Eve's damage to enemies they pass through as they return.\nShould Tainted Eve have more blood clots than room in her health bar when doing this, a red blood stream will appear on her for each excess blot clot.

Sumptorium will drain half a coin heart which is not usually seen for these characters.\n Bethany/ Book of Virtues: It will create red wisps for every clot consumed, and they will disappear if she starts creating clots again. Soul charges cannot be used to create wisps.\n Jacob and Esau: Sumptorium will only affect the brother whom it was given. Both brothers will generate clots at the same pace if given to both, but will only consume the clots from the brother that used the item.\n Tainted Magdalene: Making clots drains Magdalene's health much quicker, and at 12 red hearts, it will only absorb most of the hearts due to the character's unique ability.\n Tainted Samson/ Berserk!: Clots made by Sumptorium will have a donkey jawbone while berserking too.\n Tainted Azazel: Clots made by Sumptorium will have an even thinner  Brimstone attack, and will sneeze too.\n Lazarus/Revival Items: Clots will be retained after losing the extra life.\n The Lost/ Tainted Lost: Unable to create clots, rendering this item useless.\n Tainted Lazarus: Sumptorium will only start making clots depending on which version it was given.

Using it after visiting the Angel/Devil Room will not teleport Isaac to the I AM ERROR room, and will instead merely teleport to the same Angel/Devil Room again.\n Using Teleport 2.0 during the The Beast fight will teleport Isaac to a random spot on the screen without interrupting the fight.\n On  Downpour II in the Mirrored World, Isaac will teleport to the Ultra Secret Room before the I AM ERROR room. Although no items spawn in it, this can be useful to find the room in the normal world with the  Red Key.\n For the next use in the Mirrored World, Isaac will teleport to the I AM ERROR room of the normal floor, not a mirrored I AM ERROR room.\n After killing Mom's Heart in Mausoleum/Gehenna, Teleport 2.0 will teleport Isaac to the I AM ERROR room with trapdoor to Corpse, even if there are unvisited rooms on the floor.",

Once one item is picked up the other will disappear.\nIn the Boss Rush Room, where all 4 items can be rerolled at once.\nWhen  There's Options or  More Options spawn two items.\nItems from chests can be rerolled.\nWhen an item pool is exhausted, every item will be rerolled to  Breakfast.\nIf Isaac runs out of red hearts in the Devil Room, then rerolls, the prices of the items switch over to soul hearts.\nUsing the D6 on an active item yields different rerolls depending on whether you picked up the active item first.\nUsing the D6 to reroll items duplicated with  Diplopia will reroll all the items into different items. The copied item will not be rerolled into the same one as the original item.\nWith  Sharp Plug and any combination of items that can infinitely regenerate health, the D6 can be used to reroll items indefinitely.\nBe careful when rerolling, as it will replace the item with another item from the current room's item pool. This can be used as an advantage in various ways; for example, after defeating The Fallen, the item will be drawn from the Devil Room pool, so Isaac can safely roll the item and also items dropped by beggars in this room will be rolled into devil deal items. This behavior can also be an advantage in Angel Rooms since  Key Piece 1 and  Key Piece 2 can be rerolled to get a free Angel Room item.",

Isaac's head, which now has flight, will be under the player's control, while his body will seek out enemies to attack by contact damage.\nThe body's movement speed is dependent on Isaac's speed.\nThe body deals 5.5 damage per tick, or up to 82.5 damage per second.\n The damage tick rate of the body has been reduced.",

Its damage per second is the highest of all chasing familiars.\n If Isaac's body is not visible (for example, through the effects of  Transcendence or previous uses of the Pinking Shears), the familiar will take upon a ghost-like body, similar to the Lost's body type.\nIf used multiple times in the same room (via battery pickups, for example), more instances of the body familiar can be spawned.\nCompared to the original game, where the Gusher sometimes walked aimlessly around the room, this version actively chases enemies.\nIf Isaac switches active items while The Pinking Shears is in effect, the body will immediately despawn for the rest of the room.\nUsing The Pinking Shears after picking up  Guillotine results in the head revolving around a shadow, making Isaac's hitbox difficult to determine.\nThe body familiar will avoid creep, and will consequently rarely damage enemies like Brains and Blighted Ovum that leave creep trails as they walk, instead opting to stand right next to them.\nUsing The Pinking Shears just above an obstacle results in the body becoming stuck in the terrain, making it useless until the obstacle is destroyed.\nIf  The Intruder is released after Pinking Shears are used, control is given back to an invisible head with only a shadow visible.

Two portals in the same room work reliably.\nIf room contents are randomized by the curse, it's possible for the portals to end up completely surrounded or even inside rocks or pits. If Isaac can't move to safety, the run can be quit and resumed to be placed at a door.\nOn  Downpour II, Ventricle Razor cannot be used to teleport between the normal and mirror world.\nThis item can be useful to exit Mom's boss room to start the Ascent, as long as you use it at least once before entering the boss room.",

This also can be used to give the player a chance to see what a ? item is before deciding if they want to consume it, if they are quick enough.\n The newly absorbed active item(s) won't be used right away, but with the next usage of Void.\n If Isaac absorbs items from a room with choice pedestals, it will count as absorbing only one item.\nIf Isaac finds another Void, such as during a Victory Lap where it is left behind in the previous lap, it will have the same active effects stored in it as the other Void.\nConsuming a second Void will create no effect.\nIf multiple copies of an active item are absorbed, using Void will activate that effect equally many times.\nAbsorbing items that would normally count towards transformations upon pickup does not give progress toward transformations.\nStat boosts upon destroying passive items are determined by the seed and are tied to the number of items destroyed, not the items themselves. If the player runs the same seed and chooses to consume different passive items, the same stat boosts will be gained.\nStat boosts are permanent and are retained if Void is dropped.\nUsing Void to absorb  Key Piece 1 and  Key Piece 2 will not permanently remove them from the run. They will continue to spawn after defeating Uriel or Gabriel no matter how many times you consume them, as long as you do not pick them up normally.\nVoid can be used generate free stat upgrades, as well as gain numerous copies of active items without use of Diplopia or the Crooked Penny.

Their effects will still not be activated after the initial item effect.\n Sacrificial Altar is properly absorbed, unlike other one-time use items, allowing Isaac to sacrifice familiars and obtain Devil Room items with each activation of Void. Possibly a glitch or oversight.\n Abyss: Consuming Abyss simply overrides the Void's stat bonus/active item mimicking effect when used to consume another item, acting as a six-charge Abyss afterwards.\n Alabaster Box: Void obtains the effect of the item, but can only be used once.\n Blank Card /  Placebo: If an item that gives Isaac a new consumable is absorbed before these items, that consumable gets used instead, possibly resulting in nothing or a harmful effect.\n Blank Card +  ? Card: Using the ? Card with an absorbed Blank Card has no effect at all. Isaac will not be teleported to the I AM ERROR room and the item and card are unaffected.\n Blood Rights +  Book of Shadows: Invincibility from an absorbed Book of Shadows will not prevent damage by Blood Rights.\n Broken Remote /  Teleport /  Teleport 2.0 /  Undefined /  Blank Card with a teleport card /  Placebo with a Telepills: Items will still be consumed when Isaac teleports.\n Clear Rune +  Soul of Lilith: The item given will immediately be consumed for stats by Void.\n Clicker: If Void is either Isaac's only item or the item most recently picked up, it will be lost upon absorbing and thus activating the Clicker.\n The D6 /  D100: If absorbed while there are other pedestal items in the room, it will reroll the items before absorbing them. Likewise, if The D6 or D100 was previously absorbed and Void is used, pedestal items will get rerolled before being absorbed.\n D Infinity: When absorbed and Void is used, replicates the effect of a random dice item.\nActs as a copy of one of the 10 dice  D Infinity can replicate, this dice is randomly chosen and does not change.\n Diplopia: On the next use, the pedestal items in the room will be consumed but another copy of the items will be spawned afterward.\n Diplopia +  Mystery Gift: If both items are absorbed in the same room, the next use of Void will only trigger  Diplopia, with the use afterward activating Mystery Gift\n Everything Jar: Consuming the Everything Jar will cause Void to spawn a poop when used, regardless of charge level.\n  Glowing Hour Glass: Upon using Void, Isaac is sent to the previous room and most changes are reverted, nullifying many other effects that Void may have absorbed. If the Glass is absorbed in a shop, Isaac is sent back to the previous room, but the Glass will be unused in the shop on its pedestal. This allows for an infinite shop donation circle, eliminating the need for a battery to be present in the shop.\n Charges are reset back to full upon each use, allowing for infinite re-tries of any room. This does, however, prevent any other items consumed previously, or from consuming any further effects as Void will instead reset the room.\n How to Jump: Be wary with this combination; without an infinite recharge, it is possible to jump to a spot that there is no way of returning from. (This can be fixed by going to the main menu and then resuming the game, however.)\n The Jar: Absorbing it with Void will not allow Isaac to pick up excess hearts.\n Jar of Flies: Absorbing it with the Void will not allow the collection and generation of flies.\n Jar of Wisps: Each use will spawn only one wisp.\n Mom's Box: Drops a trinket every time the Void is used. The other passive effects of holding the box do not apply to the user.\n Moving Box: Moving Box will not be added to Void; instead, it is converted into stat boosts like a passive item.\n A Pony: Absorbing it with Void will not give a passive ability to fly; however, Isaac will still charge in the first direction chosen.\n Remote Detonator: Absorbing it with Void does not cause bombs to remain on the ground until Void is used, but using Void explodes all player-placed bombs as usual.\n Spin to Win: A spinning top orbital will spawn every time the Void is used. The orbitals will last until Isaac leaves the room.\n White Pony: Absorbing it with Void will not give a passive ability to fly. Isaac will still charge in the first direction chosen, but no beams of light will spawn.\n Stitches: Absorbing it with the Void won't do anything since the familiar you normally swap places with doesn't spawn.\nAbsorbed, multistage Active Items such as  Shoop Da Whoop! or  Red Candle: Using Void while holding a passive item above Isaac's head will not absorb the item.",
