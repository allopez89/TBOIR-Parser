For each activation of the candle, a new wisp is added for the duration of the blue flame. If the wisp stays after the flame disappears depends on the type of charge used to activate the blue flame: For a full charge, it only stays if the generated blue flame hit an enemy. For a partial charge (due to  Bethany's ability, etc.), the wisp always stays. Wisps are reset to one if the blue flame does not hit an enemy.\n Clear Rune: Spawns a purple-glowing rune wisp.

        "Interactions": "Book of Virtues: Spawns a tiny ghost wisp on the middle ring. These tiny ghosts are reminiscent of  The Soul. These wisps' tears have a 10% chance of invoking  II - The High Priestess on enemies. This wisp is also spawned when Mom's Shovel is used, alongside its unique wisp.",
        "Tips for Obtaining": "Characters with high damage like  Judas or  Azazel are excellent for blazing through the first floor in enough time.\n Cain has decent health and damage as well as the highest base speed of any character.\nAzazel has flight and very high base speed, but his lack of any health besides Black Hearts can make surviving the rest of the run more difficult; his  0 - The Fool card allows him to return to the spawn room quickly; this is not needed to obtain the Broken Shovel, as there is no time limit to claim the shovel itself, however, one can use it to cut down on time should they go the wrong way first time around.\nPlaying Judas makes it impossible to obtain this item if certain conditions are met; if no soul hearts or bomb pickups spawn on the first floor or in the shop, and if the item spawned by the boss room does not increase your health, it will be impossible to perform the last step and obtain the Broken Shovel.\n Bethany's  Book of Virtues allows you to pick up the Broken Shovel while retaining the book. These cause the wisps to become tiny ghosts reminiscent of  The Soul. When a tear shot by the wisp hits an enemy, there's a chance for Mom's leg to stomp on them. Additionally, you can use the Broken Shovel using soul hearts, allowing for more frequent usage at the cost of not being able to pick up soul/black hearts throughout the run.\n Tainted Magdalene can be extremely powerful in this challenge, especially if one obtains the  Sharp Plug. Spamming her  Yum Heart can circumvent any and all damage taken, making her invincible while killing things, and can even be used offensively on its own once the Negative is obtained due to the Necronomicon effect, provided you are at the half heart interval (half heart -> 2 heart heal from Yum Heart -> take 2 hearts of damage to charge Yum Heart again, triggering The Negative).\nTry not to slow down for pickups, items, or any unnecessary rooms while progressing to the boss room. They can be returned to after clearing the rest of the floor and killing the boss.\nThere is no time limit on claiming the shovel, as long as the floor boss was killed within the time limit.\nSpawning the Broken Shovel early will force Isaac to carry it through the rest of the floor, increasing the chance of losing health; therefore, the shovel should only be spawned when Isaac is ready to move onto the next floor.\nEven if a bomb or an item that spawns bombs or explosions cannot be found, it is still possible to claim the shovel; if the requirements to claim the shovel are met, hurting Isaac in the Sacrifice Room will spawn a one-time bomb on the first hit.\nIf Isaac no longer has this bomb or does not have enough health to survive the sacrifice, the shovel will be unobtainable, forcing a restart.\nRestarting to spawn next to a Treasure Room can make runs with the Broken Shovel much easier.\n Look for items such as  Host Hat to trivialize the stomp damage, or for damage/tear-increasing items to kill enemies quicker; conversely, when running into a mini-boss, getting Curse of the Maze or Labyrinth, or encountering poor floor generation such as multiple large rooms and dead ends, restarting may be a better choice.\n Stomp damage can no longer be negated.\nThe shovel will only be obtainable if and only if the first-floor boss dies before the timer hits 01:00. If Mom's voice is not heard after the boss is defeated, the shovel will not be obtainable.\nIf the criteria to spawn the shovel are not met and there is ambiguity as to whether it is obtainable, look for a large, faint shadow of the shovel covering the spawn room; if it is not there, the shovel cannot be obtained.",

The Forgotten and  The Soul,   Jacob and Esau,  Tainted Lazarus and   Dead Tainted Lazarus, and   Tainted Forgotten and   Tainted Soul are all counted as inherently linked dual-characters.\n Non-tainted characters can only transform into other non-tainted characters, and tainted characters can only transform into other tainted characters.\nIt is possible for the Clicker to choose the same character as the one that is already being played as, making it seem like the item created no effect at all.\nTransforming into a new character does not grant Isaac the starting items of the new character unless they are inherent to the character. For example, transforming into  Cain does not grant  Lucky Foot.\nHealth is conserved between characters.\nAll Red Heart containers will be lost, and all bone heart containers will be emptied when changing into  ???,   Dark Judas,   Tainted ???,   Tainted Judas or   Tainted Forgotten. They will gain a half Soul Heart if they would otherwise have no health.\nAll health will be lost when changing into  The Lost. Changing from The Lost to any other character will leave them with a half Soul Heart.\n  Keeper will always start with 2 Coin Heart containers. Bone and Half Soul/Black Hearts will be rounded up to 1 or 2 filled coins. Red Hearts are not rounded which allows him to have half Coin Hearts. Changing from Keeper to any other character will turn his Coin Hearts into Red Hearts.\n All Red Heart containers are converted to Coin Heart containers when transforming into Keeper, with a minimum of 2 and up to a maximum of 3. Only red hearts will determine if the coin heart containers are filled or not, and Soul/Black hearts will be converted into blue flies. One coin heart container will be filled if he would otherwise have no health. Changing from Keeper to any other character will turn his Coin Hearts into Red Hearts.\nChanging into  The Forgotten will not affect  The Soul's health. Red Hearts are converted into Bone Hearts. Soul/Black Hearts will be lost. He will gain an empty Bone Heart if he would otherwise have no health.\n All soul hearts will be converted to soul charges when changing into  Bethany. She will gain one full Red Heart container if she would otherwise have no health. Changing from Bethany to any other character will convert her soul charges into soul hearts.\n Heart Containers will be divided evenly and split up when changing into  Jacob and Esau. Changing from Jacob and Esau to any other character will leave them with Jacob and Esau's combined health.\nActivating Clicker typically only consumes passive items, but with  Schoolbag it can consume the item in the other activated item slot if that item was the most recently collected.\nSimilarly to items such as  Judas' Shadow and  Lazarus' Rags, any completion marks obtained will correspond with the character the Clicker turns you into.\n  Tainted Cain can craft the Clicker and other useful items and then use Clicker to change characters.  In this way, runs started as Tainted Cain can be useful to complete other character's completion marks, even when Tainted Cain's own completion marks are finished.  Although Clicker will only turn tainted characters into other tainted characters, Tainted Cain can also craft  Lazarus' Rags and die to become a non-tainted character and could then use the Clicker to change into other non-tainted characters.\n Removed items still count towards transformations.\nChanging into  Eden or   Tainted Eden will not use tokens. Additionally, (Tainted) Eden's base stats will be the same as Isaac's if he wasn't the character selected at the start of the run.\n Changing into  Jacob and Esau will randomly distribute items between the two. Changing from Jacob and Esau to any other character will leave them with Jacob and Esau's combined items. Changing into or from Jacob and Esau will drop the currently held consumables like pills, cards etc. on the floor, but will keep trinkets (if they were held by Jacob or any other character). Esau's trinkets will always be dropped on the ground when changing to a different character.\nIf  Dead Cat was the last item to be picked up, Clicker will remove individual lives instead of the entire item.\nIf  Halo of Flies was the last item to be picked up, Clicker will only remove one fly at a time (including Pretty Flies obtained from pills and Slot Machines) instead of the entire item.",

They will most likely hit any enemies or projectiles Isaac runs through if the player does not use the drop button to make them stay still.\n Libra: Libra is extremely detrimental to how Dark Arts works, and should be avoided: The speed boost during the invincibility phase is transferred into attack bonuses (Which are useless as tears cannot be used), and afterwards, the temporary damage boost is divided across all of Isaac's stats, resulting in very negligible stat boosts.\nUsing  Pause while there are enemies and also tagging the White Fire Place will extinguish it.",

However, when releasing a Swarm Fly, a new swarm is generated for it.\nIf a Heart is caught and then released, a Mask can use the friendly heart to live even if its original heart is destroyed. The room will not be cleared unless the Mask is killed.\nThe mask will ignore the friendly heart yet can still damage it. Bait the mask to charge towards the heart to destroy both.\nIf an Ipecac-capable enemy is caught, the explosive Ipecac shots it fires will not hurt Isaac.\nThis explosion immunity also applies to enemies that explode on death, and even the Troll Bombs left behind by Mulligoons.\nThe head of Rag Man can be captured by the ball while detached. It will not become a Ragling after being released, and only chases enemies by rolling.\nCaptured Bishops will protect Isaac with their shield generation ability, as well as all other friendly enemies. Isaac cannot take any damage while the Bishop is alive, as it will protect him with the shield. Protecting the Bishop can be a powerful defensive tool, especially when playing as  The Lost.\nThe shield does not protect against instant death effects such as  Suicide King or  Plan C.\nCaptured Cultists will revive killed enemies as friendlies, allowing one to slowly amass an army of friendlies by protecting the Cultist.\nBosses and degraded bosses can be revived by a friendly Cultist, but will not persist between rooms.",

It has a Bed, two random Chests, two Sacks, and a random Trinket. The only way out is through the beam of light.\nThis includes resetting the character to the initial one even if they had transformed due to items such as  Ankh.\nFor every item removed using Genesis, there will be a set of three items from the removed item's pool to choose from, each set appearing one after the other.\nIf used on one of the final floors of the game, such as  Chest,  Dark Room, or  The Void, the beam of light will be replaced with a  Crawl Space that leads Isaac back to the starting room of the floor he used it on. In addition, the aforementioned chests will include items. These items will not disappear along the \"choice\" pedestals.

This allows her to quickly gather power again after the reset.\nIf used as  Eden, a new set of items and stats will be generated. The first random passive item Eden starts with is rerolled immediately with no choice of three.\nIf Isaac uses Genesis while in  Downpour /  Mines /  Mausoleum or their variants, the trapdoor can send him back to the regular floors unintentionally.\nUsing Genesis after defeating Mom's Heart on  Mausoleum II will teleport Isaac to a room that is empty besides a trapdoor leading to  Corpse I and the three item selections.\nSince Genesis resets Isaac's health, it is one way to remove Broken Hearts.\n Crawl Spaces can be generated and entered inside the Genesis room, but upon leaving them, Isaac will be returned to the floor Genesis was used on instead of returning to the room.\nSimilarly, a Red Chest or  Joker can teleport Isaac to a  Devil Room or  Angel Room, and leaving will return Isaac to the room Genesis was used in.\nItem tables will not be reset, however any lost items can be obtained again if they spawn.\nUsing Genesis will remove some important items (such as  Knife Piece 1 or 2), but not others (like  The Polaroid,  The Negative,  Key Piece 1 or 2, etc.).\nTake caution; choosing an active item while holding another one will not drop the previous item to the ground, but replace it.",

This consumes Eden's Blessing, and the next run Isaac starts will not begin with a random item.\n Esau Jr.: Using Genesis as Esau Jr. will revert back to the original character.\n Glowing Hour Glass: Using it works as intended and will give back all previous stats, items, pickups, and health.\n Magic Skin: Genesis does not remove the downside of Magic Skin; any of the choice pedestals can be replaced by Magic Skin.\n Pandora's Box: Using it inside the Genesis room will spawn  The Bible. Picking it up does not affect the choice pedestals.\n Teleport! /  Teleport 2.0 / Telepills / Teleport Cards: Should such items/consumables be obtained in the Genesis room, they can be used to circumvent the forced floor skip.\nIn the case of pills, unidentified pills should only be popped after taking all of the items, for the Genesis room cannot be returned to after leaving.\n Wild Card: Can't activate Genesis.",

The reason for this is that you immediately change rooms after the Joker card is used, as such reverting to before it was used is impossible.\nDoes not return health lost entering or leaving a Curse Room, as the health was lost in the previous room.\n Does not return keys or health used to enter special rooms.\nDoes not preserve the Devil Room or Angel Room door if used to return to the Boss Room.\nDoes not turn a character back into another should they have been revived by  Ankh,  Lazarus' Rags, or  Judas' Shadow.\n Character changes are reverted by Glowing Hour Glass.\n Does not affect the chance for a portal to  The Void to spawn (the portal will not spawn if it didn't spawn initially).\n Donations to the Donation Machine or Greed Machine are not reverted, and they can be reset into a working state once jammed.\nOther counters not tied to your specific run, such as Slot Machines or Tinted Rocks destroyed, continue to accumulate, allowing easy unlocking of secrets such as the  Counterfeit Penny, the  D4, and Conquest if you have access to infinite uses of the Glowing Hour Glass (see below).\nWith the Curse of the Blind, Glowing Hour Glass can be used to pick up or purchase an unknown item to see what it is, then decide whether or not to undo picking it up.\nUsing the Glowing Hour Glass to prevent picking the Glowing Hour Glass up while previously having had an active item will return the active item and discharge it completely.\nNo Damage Achievements are still available if the Glowing Hour Glass is used to reset damage.\n Perfection is still able to drop if the Glowing Hour Glass is used to reset damage.\n Isaac's temporary familiars (Blue Flies and Spiders) duplicate when using the Glowing Hour Glass.\nIf combined with  The Battery or  Sharp Plug while Blue Spiders are present, this combo can generate an infinite army of Blue Spiders.\nThe Retro Vision Pill will continue to affect the game even after using the Glowing Hour Glass.\n Can be used to unlock multiple achievements tied to the killing of certain bosses such as Mom's Heart / It Lives.\nIf there is a Lil' Battery in a Shop, the Glowing Hour Glass can be used infinitely, by entering the Shop without a charge and using the Lil' Battery to recharge and exit the shop. This is useful for duplicating temporary familiars or filling up the Donation Machine, among other uses.\n Using the Glowing Hour Glass right after beating Mom's Heart / It Lives / Ultra Greed allows you to get additional Eden tokens.\n If a new game is started and  Eden begins with this item, using it in the first room will cause the game to crash.\nDoes not remove collection page entries if it undoes collecting an item for the first time.\n Using the Glowing Hour Glass after beating Mom's Heart in  Mausoleum/ Gehenna II will transport the player to the previous room without the Knife Pieces, but the door to Mom's Heart will also be closed.

Items that modify your stats and have other additional effects will keep the stats but the effect will be gone after leaving the room.

Brittle Bones can still be used to gain permanent tears ups if bone hearts are available.\n Crown of Light only adds soul hearts, no damage multiplier.\n Dead Cat will only restore one red heart without setting heart containers to 1. It also gives no extra lives.\n Deep Pockets,  Little Baggy,  Polydactyly, and  Starter Deck allow picking up two consumables while in the room and kept outside, but using them will lose the extra slot.\n Eden's Blessing will not grant an extra item for the next run.\n Fate only grants flight, no eternal heart.\n PHD will not identify pills, but they are still guaranteed to not be negative.\n Schoolbag allows picking up two activated items while in the room and they can be kept even outside, but the extra slot and one of the items is lost if another activated item is picked up.\n Mega Mush stats increases and Isaac's appearance revert on changing rooms, but Isaac retains the shadow of his large size, the ability to crush rocks, and invulnerability until the 30 seconds are up.\nThe following items remain active until the Metronome is used again or replaced with another active item:\n Mom's Knife\n Technology\nThe following items have no effect:\nItems that only spawn pickups or consumables are not mentioned separately.\n Ankh,  Blue Map,  Breath of Life,  Broken Watch,  Camo Undies,  C Section,  The Candle,  The Compass,  Contagion,  Death's List,  Experimental Treatment,  Holy Mantle,  The Jar,  Judas' Shadow,  Lazarus' Rags,  Marrow,  The Mind,  Missing No.,  More Options,   Notched Axe,  Poke Go,  Purity,  Red Candle,  Spelunker Hat,  Treasure Map",

Its death animation is much longer than the time between using Plan C and Isaac's Last Will appearing, meaning Isaac will die first and it will not count as a kill. Having extra lives that revive Isaac outside the room will not help, either; Delirium must be fought again.\nHowever, items that revive Isaac in the same room he died in, namely  Lazarus' Rags (or being  Lazarus),  Inner Child,  Soul of Lazarus, and  Tainted Lost's  Birthright, will allow Isaac to bypass this and kill Delirium with this item.

Each screen static plays a cutscene that continues to play even while paused, so by pausing and unpausing at the right timings, Delirium's death animation can be shortened to just under 3 seconds allowing for his completion mark to be awarded.\n Will not work if used against Ultra Greed's second phase as  Tainted Forgotten,  The Lost,  Tainted Lost, or  Tainted Jacob in his lost form (using this item as him will kill Dark Esau, putting Tainted Jacob in his lost form, meaning it practically doesn't work at all).\n Killing Mother's second phase with Plan C will kill Isaac just at the end of her death animation. Without an extra life no completion mark is awarded, but any extra life, including ones that spawn Isaac outside the room, will grant just enough extra time to receive the completion mark.\n Killing Dogma's second phase with Plan C will kill Isaac while the screen is faded to black. Any extra life item, including those that revive him outside the room, will work and still take him to the Beast fight.\n The Beast and the Ultra Harbingers can all be killed simultaneously by Plan C. Isaac technically dies a few frames before the ending plays, but it is still counted as a win and thus Plan C can still be safely used, even without an extra life.\nInvulnerable enemies and closed Hosts will not be killed by Plan C.\nIsaac's last will shows his last damage source as the cause of death, not Plan C. If Isaac has not taken damage or lost health from any source, Isaac's face is shown.\nInvincibility or the  Holy Mantle shield will not save Isaac from being killed.\nSome items that activate when Isaac reaches zero hearts, such as  Heartbreak and  Spirit Shackles, will not activate and save Isaac.\nEven if Isaac enters a trapdoor immediately after using Plan C, he will still die after arriving at the next floor.\nIsaac will also die after accepting a Victory Lap or performing a RERUN.\nPlan C has an 80% decreased item pool weight, making it less likely to appear than other collectibles.\nPlan C is found in 5 item pools, the highest count amongst all items. Its lowered weight, however, offsets its presence.",

Normal rooms will not show the red outline if they are at the map's boundary.\nRed rooms enable Isaac to enter several special rooms on the normal map without any resources or special conditions. These include  Secret Rooms,  Super Secret Rooms,  Challenge Rooms,  Vaults, and Bedrooms.\nRed  Shops will regularly not offer items from the Shop item pool for sale, but instead draw from Boss and Treasure Room pools instead. Additionally, Red Shops have a chance to become advanced Shops with many more items for sale, akin to  Tainted Keeper's better Shops.\nRed Key can't overwrite  Secret Rooms or  Super Secret Rooms. This can be used to discern their locations by finding walls that don't have red door outlines in a valid Red Room spot.\nRed Key can't create a room adjacent to the  Boss Room on most floors, with some exceptions:\nRed Key can create a room adjacent to Hush's room in the top right where the room that leads to  The Void usually generates. The door to this looks like a crack.\nThis Red Room can only be created when Isaac is in another Red Room adjacent to it, i.e. from branching off one of the  Treasure Rooms and going around Hush's room. Isaac cannot create it inside the boss room, even after Hush is defeated.\nIsaac can enter Hush's room from this crack, but going the other direction will lead him to the Entrance Portal room.\nRed Key can create rooms adjacent to Boss Rooms in  The Void, including Delirium's room.\nIsaac can use this mechanic to find Delirium's room by creating rooms until he gets two adjacent rooms with boss doors on the same wall.\nThere's a small chance that this may be Mr. Fred instead.\nRed Key can create rooms adjacent to the  Boss Room in the Mirrored World of  Downpour/ Dross II.\nAside from  XVIII - The Moon?, Red Key is the most reliable way to reach  Ultra Secret Rooms, which have the  Home floor layout and are very likely to contain an Angel Room item.\nWhen Isaac enters any Red Room adjacent to the  Ultra Secret Room, it immediately appears on the map along with the Secret Room sound, and its door will automatically open.\nIf Isaac encounters a Red Special Room, all of its doors will be its special theme doors.\nAll doors in a Red  Curse Room still feature spikes, which will damage Isaac if he decides to enter/exit.\nA Red  Vault's doors or a Red  Dice Room's doors each require two keys to open. The door where Isaac uses Red Key will be automatically unlocked, but the other doors remain locked until Isaac goes through them from inside or unlocks them from outside.\nMultiple Red special rooms of the same type can spawn on one floor.\nAll Red  Sacrifice Rooms will have their own independent use counters and rewards.\nIf Isaac has a teleport to a specific room ( XVII - The Stars,  IX - The Hermit,  Teleport 2.0, etc.) and has created a special room such that there are multiple of a certain type on one floor, the teleport will choose randomly between each room.\nHowever, if Isaac has found a Red  Planetarium, XVII - The Stars will always teleport Isaac to it over any  Treasure Rooms.\nIt is possible to obtain  Knife Piece 1 and  Knife Piece 2 outside of the intended methods by spawning Treasure Rooms that contain them.\nIn  Downpour II or  Dross II, if Isaac enters a Red Room after touching the White Fireplace and becoming  The Lost, he will still be The Lost in every Red Room, but will change back to his regular form when entering a normal room.\nIsaac is able to create Red Rooms in the Mirrored World of  Downpour II or  Dross II. They will be reflections of the original floor's Red Rooms, and special rooms created in this way will still be empty.\nRed Rooms can't be created around the  Mine Cart Room of  Mines II or  Ashpit II.\nRed Rooms on  Depths I/II can contain Marked Skulls even before the Ascent is unlocked.\nRed Rooms created in  Downpour or  Dross I/II may contain the White Fireplace, which allows Isaac to switch into  The Lost temporarily.\nRed Rooms created in  Mines or  Ashpit I/II may contain the special yellow buttons used for the Mine Cart Room. These buttons have no actual effect. Even in floor II, Isaac still needs to find the three original buttons.\nWhen in  Chest or  Dark Room, their spawn room containing their respective chests can be created by the Red Key.\nNew Mega Satan doors can't be found in these rooms.\nRed Chests in a Red starting room of  Dark Room won't contain any Devil Deals and function as normal Red Chests.",

Isaac cannot use this to reach the hidden closet room containing Tainted characters, however. Using it after visiting the Angel/Devil Room will not teleport Isaac to the I AM ERROR room, and will instead merely teleport to the same Angel/Devil Room again.\nIf used during the Ascent (without having explored any rooms), Isaac will be teleported to the spawn room for the floor, containing the light used to transition between levels. This effectively enables Isaac to skip fighting through Ascent levels if the enemies prove to be too challenging.\n Using Teleport 2.0 during the The Beast fight will teleport Isaac to a random spot on the screen without interrupting the fight.\n On  Downpour II in the Mirrored World, Isaac will teleport to the Ultra Secret Room before the I AM ERROR room. Although no items spawn in it, this can be useful to find the room in the normal world with the  Red Key.\n For the next use in the Mirrored World, Isaac will teleport to the I AM ERROR room of the normal floor, not a mirrored I AM ERROR room.\n After killing Mom's Heart in Mausoleum/Gehenna, Teleport 2.0 will teleport Isaac to the I AM ERROR room with trapdoor to Corpse, even if there are unvisited rooms on the floor.",

Once one item is picked up the other will disappear.\nIn the  Boss Rush Room, where all 4 items can be rerolled at once.\nWhen  There's Options or  More Options spawn two items.\nItems from chests can be rerolled.\nWhen an item pool is exhausted, every item will be rerolled to  Breakfast.\nIf Isaac runs out of red hearts in the  Devil Room, then rerolls, the prices of the items switch over to soul hearts.\nUsing the D6 on an active item yields different rerolls depending on whether you picked up the active item first.\nUsing the D6 to reroll items duplicated with  Diplopia will reroll all the items into different items. The copied item will not be rerolled into the same one as the original item.\nWith  Sharp Plug and any combination of items that can infinitely regenerate health, the D6 can be used to reroll items indefinitely.\nBe careful when rerolling, as it will replace the item with another item from the current room's item pool. This can be used as an advantage in various ways; for example, after defeating The Fallen, the item will be drawn from the Devil Room item pool, so Isaac can safely roll the item into another from that pool.

Two portals in the same room work reliably.\nIf room contents are randomized by the curse, it's possible for the portals to end up completely surrounded or even inside rocks or pits.

Using any multiple-use item before absorbing it with Void will effectively allow you to use the item twice.\n If Void is used while Isaac is holding an item above his head, it can still consume the item, allowing to immediately absorb passive items bought from Devil Deals, Black Markets or Shops. This also can be used to give the player a chance to see what a ? item is before deciding if they want to consume it, if they are quick enough.\n The newly absorbed active item(s) won't be used right away, but with the next usage of Void.\n If Isaac absorbs items from a room with choice pedestals, it will count as absorbing only one item.\nIf Isaac finds another Void, such as during a Victory Lap where it is left behind in the previous lap, it will have the same active effects stored in it as the other Void.\nConsuming a second Void will create no effect.\nIf multiple copies of an active item are absorbed, using Void will activate that effect equally many times.\nAbsorbing items that would normally count towards transformations upon pickup does not give progress toward transformations.\nStat boosts upon destroying passive items are determined by the seed and are tied to the number of items destroyed, not the items themselves. If the player runs the same seed and chooses to consume different passive items, the same stat boosts will be gained.\nStat boosts are permanent and are retained if Void is dropped.\nUsing Void to absorb  Key Piece 1 and  Key Piece 2 will not permanently remove them from the run. They will continue to spawn after defeating Uriel or Gabriel no matter how many times you consume them, as long as you do not pick them up normally.\nVoid can be used generate free stat upgrades, as well as gain numerous copies of active items without use of Diplopia or the Crooked Penny.

Their effects will still not be activated after the initial item effect.\n Sacrificial Altar is properly absorbed, unlike other one-time use items, allowing Isaac to sacrifice familiars and obtain Devil Room items with each activation of Void. Possibly a glitch or oversight.\n Abyss: Consuming Abyss simply overrides the Void's stat bonus/active item mimicking effect when used to consume another item, acting as a six-charge Abyss afterwards.\n Alabaster Box: Void obtains the effect of the item, but for only one use.\n Blank Card /  Placebo: If an item that gives Isaac a new consumable is absorbed before these items, that consumable gets used instead, possibly resulting in nothing or a harmful effect.\n Blank Card +  ? Card: Using the ? Card with an absorbed Blank Card has no effect at all. Isaac will not be teleported to the I AM ERROR room and the item and card are unaffected.\n Blood Rights +  Book of Shadows: Invincibility from an absorbed Book of Shadows will not prevent damage by Blood Rights.\n Book of Virtues: Spawns the wisps of all the active items Void has absorbed. Spawns no wisps by itself. Using Void on Book of Virtues will give stat upgrades instead of its normal effect, as Book of Virtues is considered a passive item.\n Broken Remote /  Teleport! /  Teleport 2.0 /  Undefined /  Blank Card with a teleport card /  Placebo with a Telepills: Items will still be consumed when Isaac teleports.\n Clear Rune +  Soul of Lilith: The item given will immediately be consumed for stats by Void.\n Clicker: If Void is either Isaac's only item or the item most recently picked up, it will be lost upon absorbing and thus activating the Clicker.\n The D6 /  D100: If absorbed while there are other pedestal items in the room, it will reroll the items before absorbing them.

If the Glass is absorbed in a shop, Isaac is sent back to the previous room, but the Glass will be unused in the shop on its pedestal. This allows for an infinite shop donation circle, eliminating the need for a battery to be present in the shop.\n Charges are reset back to full upon each use, allowing for infinite re-tries of any room. This does, however, prevent any other items consumed previously, or from consuming any further effects as Void will instead reset the room.\n How to Jump: Be wary with this combination; without an infinite recharge, it is possible to jump to a spot that there is no way of returning from. (This can be fixed by going to the main menu and then resuming the game, however.)\n The Jar: Absorbing it with Void will not allow Isaac to pick up excess hearts.\n Jar of Flies: Absorbing it with the Void will not allow the collection and generation of flies.\n Jar of Wisps: Each use will spawn only one wisp.\n Mom's Box: Drops a trinket every time the Void is used. The other passive effects of holding the box do not apply to the user.\n Moving Box: Moving Box will not be added to Void; instead, it is converted into stat boosts like a passive item.\n A Pony: Absorbing it with Void will not give a passive ability to fly; however, Isaac will still charge in the first direction chosen.\n Remote Detonator: Absorbing it with Void does not cause bombs to remain on the ground until Void is used, but using Void explodes all player-placed bombs as usual.\n Spin to Win: A spinning top orbital will spawn every time the Void is used. The orbitals will last until Isaac leaves the room.\n Stitches: Absorbing it with the Void won't do anything since the familiar Isaac normally swap places with doesn't spawn.\n White Pony: Absorbing it with Void will not give a passive ability to fly. Isaac will still charge in the first direction chosen, but no beams of light will spawn.\n Absorbed, multistage Active Items such as  Shoop Da Whoop! or  Red Candle: Using Void while holding a passive item above Isaac's head will not absorb the item.",
